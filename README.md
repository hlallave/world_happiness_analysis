# World Happiness Analysis
This is the first Data Analytics project I did back on June 2021 using Python. 
I do have long time experience in Data Analysis, but I always worked with Excel spreadsheets and other analytics softwares that did not require coding (except from a few simple SQL queries).  

Said that, my main goals for this project where the following ones: 

- Analytical goals:
    - Indentify what makes people happy according to the happiness report.
    - Find out happier and unhappier regions.
    - Look for some curiosities.
    
- Techical goals:
    - A good data cleaning.
    - Play around with markdown formatting options.
    - Make some nice, informative plots.
    - Code, code, code :)

You can see all the project (including code and comments) in the notebook called HLF_Bimodule_1. 

By this time, I hadn't learned yet any Machine Learning alogirthms. Please go into my other repositories if you are keen to see my Data Science projects and my learning progress.
